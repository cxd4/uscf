<p>This resource is an online synchronicity of (usually rated and official) chess matches that, per tournament rules, must be recorded by both chess players--myself and my opponent (even if I am the loser in some of them).</p>

<p>Here is my <a href="http://www.uschess.org/assets/msa_joomla/MbrDtlMain.php?14503710">USCF profile</a>, which is always up-to-date with my tournament history, rankings, players I've won and lost against, and my monthly rating.  It does not disclose any of my chess games, however, which are my responsibility to record and provide.  (So far, I've never actually needed to furnish any of them as proof to a TD to settle a dispute with my opponent or anything like that, but we're still always expected to record all of our games just in case.)</p>

<p>My chess games are currently viewable in two formats:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="viewer.html">single-file format</a>--entire history of all games put together in one single text file (minimal annotations, very little analysis in the comments, helpful to do Ctrl+F or whatever to find games played with certain opening moves and the like)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cxd4/uscf/">tournament year trees</a>--directories by year in which I've played rated tournaments, each with one smaller, more organized game database per tournament played and with more comments</li>
</ul>

<p>The latter option (tournament year trees) is more recommended for the specific analysis of each game played within a tournament, as smaller PGN files devoted only in scope to one tournament's worth of games are easier for me to talk to myself to death in.  Follow the links below to view tournament-specific databases of my games for better comments and detail:</p>

<p>Older chess events that I participated in between 2002 to 2010 were all casual and unrated.  None were recorded on paper.</p>

<p>Originally, I did not make much effort to maintain my local database (especially to the public) at first since I mostly just stuck to transcripting the paper recordings to my computer so I could throw away the paper, but after going back and really re-assessing and analyzing my old games through the top engines of today (i.e., Stockfish and Komodo), I've added so many comments and had a renewed interest in organizing my old records better.  (Plus if I have a hard disk failure, the Internet will still have them.)</p>
